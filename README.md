jinja for loop problem:
I had the cuisine categories stored in mlab to access through a for loop within another forloop which accessed my 
recipes. All the select input fields were expected to show the cuisine categories, except only the first select input
field show all the categories and the one following it onl;y displayed their previous add category. To fix this I
added the cuisine category as a json format to a separate py file.
